## What is this?

This repository is for sharing and cooperating in the development process of the Hearts of Iron IV mod: End of a New Beginning. 

### Development

If you wish to support the development of the mod, join the team, join our Discord Server and create an application in `#faq`. Applicants will be given the `Curia` Team Member Role and the `Disciplio` Trial Role. After passing the Trial Period, members will be fully accepted into the team and be given GitHub write access if applicable.

Rules for Developers
- Current General Development for EoaNB shall be pushed onto the `experimental` branch.
- All code should be error-checked before pushed onto the Github
- Merging should be done carefully and procedurely. Do not override other developers' work without acknowledgment of the team.
- If procedural pushing (including incomplete content) is crucial to development, request a new branch.
- Merging any branch into the master branch (the distributed branch) will require a pull request which can only be initialised by a *Centurion*, and requires the approval of at least another Centurion. Errors are to be checked and minimalised by the Centurion who does the request.

### Usage

End of a New Beginning is a `free to play, open source mod`.

If you would like to work on the mod but do not wish to apply for the team, you are free to fork the repository and modify it, and redistribute it for private use. Content of EoaNB is licensed under the `GNU General Public License 3.0`, which means you have to alert users you are redistributing a modified, unofficial version of EoaNB.

We do not tolerate using content developed for EoaNB for other purposes. Any other source doing such things or are claiming ownership/profiting from our work may be liable to legal disputes.

### Crash Troubleshooting

`Recalculating Naval Distances Crash`: The current version of our mod crashes during the game-booting process between the launcher window and the main menu for some users with incompatible graphics cards. A good fix for most users has been to enter the Steam Library and enter the option `-opengl` into Hearts of Iron 4's launch settings.
