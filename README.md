## What is this?

This repository is for sharing and cooperating in the development process of the Hearts of Iron IV mod: End of a New Beginning. 

### Development

If you wish to support the development of the mod, join the team, join our Discord Server and create an application in `#faq`. Applicants will be given the `Curia` Team Member Role and the `Disciplio` Trial Role. After passing the Trial Period, members will be fully accepted into the team and be given GitHub write access if applicable.

Rules for Developers
- Current General Development shall be pushed onto the `experimental` branch.
- All code should be error-checked before pushed onto the Github
- Merging should be done carefully and procedurely. Do not override other developers' work without acknowledgment of the team.
- If procedural pushing (including incomplete content) is crucial to development, request a new branch.
- Merging any branch into the master branch (the distributed branch) will require a pull request which can only be initialised by a Centurion, and requires the approval of at least another Centurion. Errors are to be checked and minimalised by the Centurion who does the request.

### Usage

End of a New Beginning is a free to play, open source mod.

If you do not wish to apply as a dev, you are free to fork the repository and modify it, redistribute it and privately use it, but the content of EoaNB is licensed under the GNU General Public License 3.0, which means you have to alert that what you're redistributing is a modified version of EoaNB.

We also do not tolerate redistribution of the components of EoaNB that are our creations without special permission. Any other source doing such things or are claiming ownership/profting from our work will be legally liable.

### Crash Troubleshooting

`Missing Together for Victory Crash`: The current version of our mod crashes on after unpausing on the first day of the game if the player does not own the Hearts of Iron IV dlc 'Together for Victory`. We are aware of this issue and it is a priority of the team to make all content not be locked behind dlc-required content. However, we have not yet pinpointed the exact code that is causing the crash.

`Recalculating Naval Distances Crash`: The current version of our mod crashes during the loading process between the launcher and the main menu at the 'Recalculating Naval Distances' section for some users with incompatible graphics cards. A good fix for many is to enter the Steam Library and enter `-opengl` to Hearts of Iron IV's launch settings.
